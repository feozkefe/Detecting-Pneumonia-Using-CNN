Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may
fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty
breathing. A variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, can cause pneumonia.
Pneumonia can range in seriousness from mild to life-threatening. It is most serious for infants and
young children, people older than age 65, and people with health problems or weakened immune
systems. 
This paper presents convolutional neural network models to accurately detecting pneumonia from
chest X-rays, which can be utilized in the real world by medical practitioners to treat pneumonia.
Experimentation was conducted on Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset available on Kaggle.
The first model consists of three convolutional layers, and the second model consist four
convolutional layers,respectively. The first model achieves an accuracy of 90.54%, the second one
reaches an accuracy of 0.89%. Dropout regularization is employed in the all models to minimize
overfitting in the fully connected layers.
